**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Please answer these questions**
1. Does your existing AR project work fine on a real AR device?
2. Do example scenes included with the plugin work? If an example scene doesn't work, please include the name of a scene and any errors/warnings. Please send the errors/warnings as text, not as screenshots.
3. Plugin version. You can find it in the 'Packages/AR Foundation Remote/package.json' file.
4. Unity version. Windows/macOS/Linux?
5. Attach your 'Packages/manifest.json' file.
6. Your AR device model and its OS version. Please make sure your AR device supports ARKit/ARCore and supports a feature you would like to test in the Editor.

**Errors, warnings, and stack traces**
Add errors/warnings from the Unity Editor and from the AR Companion if any. Please send errors and warnings as text, not as screenshots (you can select all console output by pressing ctrl/cmd+a, then copy it by pressing ctrl/cmd+c).
If the Editor is crashing, you can find Unity Editor logs [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html).
