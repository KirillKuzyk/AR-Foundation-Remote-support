**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Please provide additional info**
1. Does your existing AR project work fine on a real AR device?
2. Do example scenes included with the plugin work? If an example scene doesn't work, please include the name of a scene and any errors/warnings. Please send the errors/warnings **as text** (with all stack traces), **NOT** as screenshots.
3. Plugin version. You can find it in the 'Packages/AR Foundation Remote/package.json' file.
4. Unity version and your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).
5. Attach your 'Packages/manifest.json' file to the bug report.
7. Press 'File/Save' in Unity, then attach your 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Resources/Settings.asset' file to the bug report.
6. Your AR device model and its OS version. Please make sure your AR device supports ARKit/ARCore and supports a feature you would like to test in the Editor.

**Errors, warnings, and stack traces**
Add errors/warnings from the Unity Editor and from the AR Companion if any. Please send errors and warnings **as text** (with all stack traces), **NOT** as screenshots (you can select all console output by pressing ctrl/cmd+a, then copy it by pressing ctrl/cmd+c).
If the Editor is crashing with the plugin, please attach your Editor.log file. You can find it [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html).
